# Mini-C-Interpreter
An Interpreter for a Mini C language that is a subset of the C language.

## **Description:**
For this project, I wrote a type-checker and interpreter for a toy imperative language named MINI-C, a C-Like language with block scoping. The type-checker and
interpreter were written in Java and incorporate a pre-provided parser and code base.

## **Mini-C Language:**
Mini-C is an imperative language that supports only the boolean and int data types along with basic arithmetic, logic, and relational operators. There are no function
calls, arrays, strings, or complex data types.

**Semantics:**

This section informally defines the semantics of each program element. Since this specification is not formal, it is likely to be ambiguous and/or incomplete but 
should nonetheless convey a reasonable specification of the expected meaning of each program element. Seek clarification of any part of the specification that you 
believe is unclear.
